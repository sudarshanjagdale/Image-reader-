Subject: Issue with Classification Model for 'Account Statement / Transaction Listing' Layout in Proving Environment

Message:

Hi Hyperscience Support Team,

We are facing an issue with the classification model in our Proving environment related to a specific layout: 'Account Statement / Transaction Listing'.

In production, the classification is working correctly. However, in proving, the model is intermittently failing to classify documents with this layout. A few days ago, we observed that these documents were not being classified at all.

We verified the training dataset, and similar types of documents are present. After retraining the model and testing the next day, the classification worked temporarily. But after another round of retraining for further testing, the issue reoccurred — the model again failed to match the layout.

This inconsistent behavior is unexpected. Could you please help us understand the reason behind this issue?

Also, we are using a classification training dataset with 23,779 documents. Could this volume be causing any classification degradation or misclassification issues? Please suggest if there’s anything we should review or optimize.

Looking forward to your insights and support.

Best regards,
Sudarshan Jagdale
Senior Program Analyst, WNS
